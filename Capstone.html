<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I am currently a final year student of a Master of Science in Geology at Queens
    University, Kingston, Ontario. I am a fast learning and adaptable professional, I like to
    be self-taught and work in a team. My academic skills from work and research
    experience are focused on geographic information systems (GIS) and data analysis. I
    have taken courses from the University in GIS and data analysis and also in high
    quality online training schools such as Coursera.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Bacherlors degree in Biology</li>
    <li>Bacherlors degree in Geological engineering</li>
    <li>Graduate student</li>
    <li>Currently, my thesis is to find the changes in the stability of a large rock mass in British
        Columbia where large rock fragments can break off and affect the train tracks of the
        most important train in Canada in terms of economy (Canadian National Railway).
        For this I am using drone images and building 3D models to represent the geometry
        and then with stability software like RS3 (rocksience) verify the stability of this place
        and analyze the hazard to the train tracks.</li>
